## Error Handling

The API uses a custom error middleware to handle errors that may occur during API calls. The error middleware returns a JSON response with the following format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "string"
}
```

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. When an admin successfully logs in, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client in the response. The client should store this token securely and include it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to authenticated endpoints.

## Database

The API uses MongoDB as its database. The database is named "Survey-Form" and contains the following collections:

- **Admins**: Stores the admin users.
- **SurveyForms**: Stores the survey forms and their responses.

## Deployment

The API is deployed on a server running Node.js and Express.js. The server is configured to listen on port 3000.

## Usage

To use the API, you can send requests to the API endpoints using a REST client such as Postman or Insomnia. Alternatively, you can use the API from your own code by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

## Conclusion

The Survey Management System is a powerful and versatile tool that revolutionizes the way survey data is collected, analyzed, and presented. Its user-friendly design and extensive features make it an ideal choice for a wide range of survey needs, from market research to customer feedback collection. With its robust API and responsive design, the system is adaptable to various use cases and platforms.
